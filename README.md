**SuiNS RFP – Supporting Materials from AngelHack Developer Labs**
Thank you for reviewing our submission for the SuiNS RFP. This repository serves as a supplementary resource to support our proposals for:
- SuiStamp – Attaching rich metadata and profiles to SuiNS names
- SuiSocial – A wallet-following protocol and on-chain social graph
- SuiFlow – A real-time on-chain activity feed for the Sui ecosystem

**About Source Code Access**
Due to NDAs signed with past and current clients, we are unable to publicly share source code from previous Move-based projects. We take IP protection seriously and operate with strict confidentiality when working on client-sensitive blockchain solutions.

**Our Experience**
Our development team has supported and onboarded over 600+ smart contract deployments on the Sui testnet, including working on one of Sui’s earliest learn-to-earn campaigns. We’ve contributed to a wide range of dApps, NFT platforms, and developer tooling in the Sui ecosystem.
